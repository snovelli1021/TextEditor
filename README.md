## Accreditations:
  Text Editor utilizes the npm packages babel and webpack to bundle a performant PWA for deployment and offline use. The text data and CRUD operations are hendled by indexdb and Express.js is used to build the server, with Node.js as the application framework. It is deployed for use publicly via Heroku.
